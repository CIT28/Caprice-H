# Problem 1
make sure I'm grouping on the correct column and know the row count expectation.
SELECT DISTINCT "year" FROM "salaries" ORDER BY "year" ASC;
1985
1986
1987
1988
1989
1990
1991
1992
1993
1994
1995
1996
1997
1998
1999
2000
2001
*should be 17

for the first pass, no rounding, ascending I just want to verify numbers look reasonable.
sqlite> SELECT "year"
FROM "salaries"
GROUP BY "year"
ORDER BY "year";
1985
1986
1987
1988
1989
1990
1991
1992
1993
1994
1995
1996
1997
1998
1999
2000
2001
I forgot to add the avg, alias, and asc.
sqlite> SELECT "year", AVG("salary") AS avg_salary
FROM "salaries"
GROUP BY "year"
ORDER BY "year" ASC;
