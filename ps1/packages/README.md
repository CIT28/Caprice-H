## Problem 1

`SELECT * FROM "drivers" WHERE "name" = 'Derek';`

## Problem 2
`SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Number Pickups for Derek in 2023"
FROM "scans"
WHERE "driver_id" = (
  SELECT "id" FROM "drivers" WHERE "name" = 'Derek' LIMIT 1
)
AND "action" = 'Pick'
AND strftime('%Y', "timestamp") = '2023'`

## Problem 3
`SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Number of Residential Addresses"
FROM "addresses"
WHERE "type" = 'Residential';`

## Problem 4
`SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Number of Business Addresses"
FROM "addresses"
WHERE "type" = 'Business';`

## Problem 5

### 1)
`SELECT "id" AS from_address_id
 FROM "addresses"
 WHERE "address" LIKE '%900 Somerville Avenue%';`

### 2)
`SELECT "id" AS to_address_id
 FROM "addresses"
 WHERE "address" LIKE '%2 Finn%';`

### 3) 
`SELECT p."id" AS package_id, p."contents"
 FROM "packages" p
 JOIN "addresses" fa ON fa."id" = p."from_address_id"
 JOIN "addresses" ta ON ta."id" = p."to_address_id"

   AND ta."address" LIKE '%2 Finn%';`

### 4)
`SELECT s."action", s."timestamp"
 FROM "scans" s
 JOIN "packages" p ON p."id" = s."package_id"
 JOIN "addresses" fa ON fa."id" = p."from_address_id"

## My Experience
I originally hard coded the IDs, which skipped the real first step of the problem and didnâ€™t show my process. After feedback, I redid it by starting from the street addresses, deriving the correct IDs, finding the matching package, and then pulling the scans. The static queries now document each step clearly, and the nested query compresses the same logic into one statement. I also fixed my folder placement and POW outputs so everything lives in ps1/packages as required. Now both approaches return the correct Pick/Drop timestamps with no hard coded IDs and a clear record of effort.

`SELECT id, contents FROM packages WHERE contents LIKE '%duck%';`

`SELECT id FROM address LIKE contents = 'Duck' LIMIT 1;`

`SELECT id FROM packages WHERE contents = 'Duck debugger' LIMIT 1;`

`SELECT s.action, s.timestamp, a.address FROM scans s JOIN addresses a ON a.id = s.address_id WHERE s.package_id = (SELECT id FROM packages WHERE contents='Duck debugger' LIMIT 1) ORDER BY s.timestamp;`

`SELECT id FROM packages WHERE contents='Duck debugger';`

`SELECT a."address" FROM "address" a WHERE "id" = (SELECT a."address" FROM "scans" a WHERE a."action" = 'Drop' AND a."address" = (SELECT "id" FROM "packages" LIKE "packages" = 'Duck' LIMIT 1) LIMIT 1);`

`SELECT a."addresses" FROM "addresses" a WHERE "id" = (SELECT a."address" FROM "scans" a LIKE a."action" = 'Drop' AND a."addresses" = (SELECT "id" FROM "packages" LIKE "packages" = 'Duck') LIMIT 1);`
